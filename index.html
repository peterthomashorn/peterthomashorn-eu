          <h2>Music</h2>
          <p>I regularly stray well beyond my home of extreme metal to experience other forms of audible beauty.
            Actually I believe that the soundtrack of my heart sounds more like Her Name Is Calla or Ólafur Arnalds rather than Cradle Of Filth and As I Lay Dying.</p>
          <h3>Bass Guitar</h3>
          <p>I play bass guitar since I was 15 years old.
            My first bass was a used Samick I took over from a friend.
            I do remember my first amp but not its brand or model – it was worn out and muffled in its sound.
            In 2007 I bought a five string Tanglewood Rebel 5K.
            People knowledgeable about guitar brands are often surprised they produce electric basses, too.
            Not much later I took over a Yorkville 200B amp from the same friend I got my first bass from.
            It was quite a bargain for what it had to offer. Brilliant heights and pushing depths.
            It is still my main amp.
            Because it is in use for more than 20 years I had to disassemble and solder on a few new potentionmeters in 2017.
            I was happy to find one replacement part at all: the volume potentiometer is a weird one and I had to order a Peavy branded replacement part from Spain because alternatively only parts from the United States were available for twice the price.</p>
          <p>The Tanglewood Rebel served me well and I had a lot of fun with it ever since.
            Eleven years later I have grown and changed just as my skills developed.
            With much more clarity about the possibilities and my requirements I bought an ESP LTD B204SM.
            It feels like a big move forward.
            Back to four strings but with two humbuckers and active electronics with an amazing tone range offers a completely different sound and playing experience.
            Maybe I won't play my Tanglewood much anymore but it has been for such a long time already, it is part of the family and will not get abandoned.
            When I am at home I usually use headphones or my Hi-Fi speakers for practicing.
            Always part of the setup is my BOSS GT-1B multi-effects processor which I consider a decent product after trying out different devices of that kind.
            There are tons of possibilities and one utilizes its full potential only after a long time.</p>
          <p>In the past I used to play much over my iMac with signal processors like Native Instruments Guitar Rig, AmpliTube or EZmix.
            Maybe it is because of my professional background that I do not have reservations as typical for rather conservative musicians.
            With my recent equipment choices my preference changed: I like to play with my ESP, GT-1B and 200B without the hassle of a computer.
            In fact I became tired of the wiring, the maintenance and the interaction for jamming.
            I return in case of song writing or recording to Guitar Pro and REAPER on the computer, though.</p>
          <h3>Electric Guitar</h3>
          <p>One year after I started with the bass guitar a few savings manifested in the cheapest electric guitar I could buy on the internet: a brand new Chinese no-name with a body of compressed wood for 40€.
            Some saturdays I played from 10 in the morning until 10 in the evening.
            Measured by todays standards the sound was awful and I had to retune every 10 minutes while the strings felt like cutting into my finger tips.
            But I learned a lot and completely by myself.</p>
          <p>In 2009 I bought a matte black Schecter Diamond Demon from the first salary I got.
            That was a hefty upgrade totally worth it.
            The years after I played with thick strings mostly in the tune range of Drop A to Drop C because I liked the deep and metallic sound as present on Bring Me The Horizon's album Suicide Season.</p>
          <h3>Keys</h3>
          <p>I had a cheap MIDI keyboard a few years ago and played sampled instruments as well as synthesizers on my computer.
            I sold it at some point. It was a simple input device bundled with a hobbyist software.
            With my wife, who plays piano since the age of four, my interest in playing this instrument reignited.
            Having a decent Yamaha E-Piano at disposal makes it much more pleasant to play.
            At most with the remarkably unique sound of Nils Frahms Una Corda sample library for Native Instruments Kontakt.
            I really love that sound.</p>
          <h3>Recording</h3>
          <p>The previously mentioned, cheap MIDI keyboard was bundled with Magix Music Maker.
            Looking back it was a beginner friendly introduction to the workflow and concept of digital audio workstations.
            I recorded my first title with Music Maker in 2008.
            Remembering it today it was a product which I would not be confidently selling.
            Slow, unstable and lacking precision in use of its interface.
            I got aware of Steinberg Cubase not so long after but with its ridiculous pricing it seemed out of question back then.
            I did not know much yet about alternative digital audio workstations.
            Luckily I was introduced to REAPER in 2009.
            It is my main tool for recording, mixing and mastering since then.
            Nothing I tried could compete with REAPER.
            It is affordable, highly efficient, feature packed but without bloat.
            It is the best solution for recording music.
            For loop based live performance Ableton Live clearly wins.</p>

          <h2>Me Elsewhere</h2>
          <p>The overwhelming amount of multimedial input needs aggressive filtering and conscious consumption to not let it numb and distract our senses from what actually matters.
            After using Facebook and Twitter for several years I drew the conclusion it is an utter waste of time.
            You invest time and get nothing out of it. And did I already mention how much I hate advertisement?
            Nearly everybody should be aware of the privacy issues by now, too. Sadly only few people care and are consequent.
            So in the end I quit. To me it is nothing else than the capitalist counterpart to Chinas mass surveillance.</p>
            <p>In the past I used to spend a lot time online and in a purely virtual layer of our society.
              I am glad I found my way back to focus on life off screen where the actual life happens.
              I pity those who seem to live in Snapchat and Instagram rather than in tangible reality.</p>
            <p>After a few months I occassionally missed that handy little outlet like Twitter. So I finally signed up at Mastodon.
              For professional reasons I am present on Xing and LinkedIn, too.
              However I often question the sense of being there. Engagement neither contributes to my value as a developer nor to my perception of a balanced life.
              Most interaction is with annoying recruiters contacting me for jobs I do not want.
              That is the reason why it might take a few weeks until I pick up a message on those channels.</p>
