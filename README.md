# My Personal Website

This is the repository for the currently simple implementation of my own website.

## Development

Originally I used plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. At some point I wanted to have features which would be time-consuming to maintain by hand. For example: cache busting URLs. So I updated the project to use Gulp for development and building.

## Third-Party Components

* The [Bebas Neue](http://bebasneue.com) web font by [Dharma Type](https://dharmatype.com)
* The Gloria Hallelujah web font by [Kimberly Geswein](http://www.kimberlygeswein.com)
