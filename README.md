# My Personal Website

This is the repository for the currently minimalistic implementation of my own website.

As a surprise this is made with old fashioned basics like plain HTML, vanilla CSS and only a hint of clean JavaScript.

## Third-Party Components

I use some customized icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com). See COPYRIGHT file for further information.
