                    <p>Some stereotypes about software developers do not apply to me.
                        I usually do not drink coffee, do not like mechanical keyboards and am an opponent to the home invasion by smart devices and the internet of things.
                        Ironically I could not care less about computer games which I abandoned a few years ago after they originally sparked my career at the age of 12.
                        I am ready for a round of chess, though. You can read more about my career as a software developer <a href="career.html">on my career page</a>.</p>
                    <p>Hungarian and German are my mother tongues. My English was proven safe for international business contracts.
                        I learned French in school for four years and I engaged with Finnish for a little bit. I have a high affinity to languages.</p>
                    <p>I am an optimistic nihilist. The YouTube channel "Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell" produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14">an appealing short film which explains it nicely</a>.
                    Summarized in one sentence: I do not believe in anything and consider human existence totally senseless beyond the purpose every individual is completely free to choose. While my purpose revolves around family I see a lot of other joyful things in life, too.</p>
                    <p>As <a href="https://www.patreon.com/peterthomashorn/creators">a proud patron on Patreon</a> I financially support open-source software projects and creators.
                        I think it is important to understand that nothing in life comes for free.
                        Somebody always pays in some way for what too many people take for granted.
                        It is not just about appreciation but also about contributing to the perhaps most essential resource: time.
                        Many projects would benefit vastly, if only one percent of their users would donate one Euro a month.
                        Maintainers could earn a competitive salary while working on their projects full time. Unfortunately such awareness never really thrived.</p>

                    <h2>I make music</h2>
                    <p>I regularly stray well beyond my home of extreme metal to experience other forms of audible beauty.
                        Actually I believe that the soundtrack of my heart sounds more like Her Name Is Calla or Ã“lafur Arnalds rather than Cradle Of Filth and As I Lay Dying.</p>
                    <p>I played the recorder while being in second grade. Well, one has to start somewhere.
                        After settling on rock and metal as my favorite style of music I bought my first bass guitar at the of 15. 
                        My first electric guitar just one year later. Since then I continuously improved my skills.
                        I wrote songs, recorded and published them. In bands and on my own.</p>

                    <h2>Books on my shelf</h2>
                    <p>During my childhood I read all books of Harry Potter, The Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit multiple times.
                    My eleventh birthday was a great disappointment because I did not receive any acceptance letter from Hogwarts.</p>
                    <p>Later on I mostly stopped reading classical books. Tablets sparked a little interest again.
                    I considered it a great deal to potentially have tons of searchable books in a small device with you.
                    After some time I realized the device itself is full of distractions and more complicated to use than the old fashioned pile of paper.
                    I started to like the analog simplicity again. Paper books do not need to be charged with electricity.
                    They do not distract you with a thousand other features. They are still on the shelf when your computer is broken.</p>
                    <p>Though I do not like to read technical documentation or education in paper form.
                    It is outdated too quickly, not searchable and often too verbose. I prefer condensed know-how over jabbering as it happens in podcasts.
                    Anyway, these are important books to me which I read and often incorporate into my thoughts:</p>

                        <h2>Beers I like</h2>
                        <p>My taste focuses on stouts and porters but also includes Kellerbier.
                            I use the mobile app Untappd to check in on mostly new beers and keep track of what I like while neglecting the social features.
                            It is funny that I could remember most of the beers I tasted until I hit the mark of 600 distinct brews after five years.<br />
                            The counting started only in 2014 when I was in Finland. A Couchsurfing host introduced me to craft beer.
                            I did think not to like beer before I turned almost 24. It was eye opening: the world is full of tasty beer, if you look beyond the industrial mainstream brews which used to rule the markets.
                            Five years later I brewed my own beer the first time.</p>

                        <figcaption>On this picture you see me in the Bavarian State Brewery Weihenstephan.
                            It is the oldest still existing brewery in the world and I was born a short stroll away from there.
                            When travelling I like to stop by notable breweries.</figcaption>

                    <h2>Me Elsewhere</h2>
                    <p>The overwhelming amount of multimedia input needs aggressive filtering and conscious consumption to not let it numb and distract our senses from what actually matters.
                        In the past I used to spend a lot time online and in a purely virtual layer of our society.
                        After using Facebook, Mastodon, Xing and Twitter for several years I drew the conclusion that it is an utter waste of time.
                        You invest attention and get nothing of worth out of it. And did I already mention how much I hate advertisement?
                        Nearly everybody should be aware of the privacy issues by now, too. Sadly only few people care and are consequent.
                        So in the end I quit. To me it is nothing else than the capitalist counterpart to China's mass surveillance.
                        I do not want to voluntarily shovel money into the pockets of people harvesting my data.</p>
                    <p>I am glad that I found my way back off screen where the actual life happens.
                        I pity those who seem to live in Snapchat and Instagram rather than in tangible reality.
                        Years spent with social networks yielded the realization of their full expendability once I left them.</p>
                    <p>For professional reasons I am still present on LinkedIn.
                        However I often question the sense of being there.
                        Engagement neither contributes to my value as a developer nor to my perception of a balanced life. And I constantly receive annoying contact requests from random recruiters and headhunters who want to add me to their network.</p>
