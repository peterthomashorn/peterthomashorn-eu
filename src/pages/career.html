                <h1>Career</h1>
                <p class="lead">Since starting software development with Java at the age of 12 I got in touch with a lot of different technologies at work and in free time. 
                    I am actively and constantly evolving my competence and apply it every day. 
                    I believe in team work to accomplish things a single individual cannot. 
                    Products and purpose are more important to me than tools and technologies. 
                    My greatest strengths are to quickly adapt to new situations, evolve my capabilities and broaden my horizons.</p>
